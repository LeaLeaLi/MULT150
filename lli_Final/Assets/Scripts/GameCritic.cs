-> The game feels pretty easy. I don't have to do much, and the colored balls tend to reach the goals quickly without much effort.

-> Making the game harder could be done by adding a rule where if balls touch each other, they disappear or reset, forcing more careful movement.

-> Adding a loud explosion sound effect when balls touch each other would create a surprising and exciting "wow" moment.

-> Watching the balls bounce around the arena quickly is very fun and satisfying.

-> There isn’t a lot of excitement after a while; once most of the balls are scored, chasing the last few can feel a bit repetitive.

Enhancements Implemented:

1. Added a timer that shows how long it takes to complete the game.
2. Changed the size of the player’s bumper to make control harder.
3. Making a complex bumper out of many shapes.
4. Added two extra chaos balls to make the game more challenging.

Is the game too easy or hard? Why?
1. The game feels hard because the pickups spawn too close to each other, so it's difficult to reach enough time boosts.
2. The phase cooldown is long, so it's hard to recover when a mistake is made.

What 2 changes would make it easier or harder?
1. I will make it harder by adding gaps in the floor (falling ground pieces) so the player has to dodge even more carefully.
2. I may also increase spawn rate so more obstacles and powerups appear faster.

What 2 things would give it a "wow" factor?
1. A huge green or golden light beam when a rare big power-up appears — like in Diablo with legendary drops.
2. A bright light or explosion in the sky when the timer ends or you reach a time milestone.

What 2 parts of the game are fun?
1. Phasing through objects feels fun and risky.
2. Watching the timer increase when grabbing power-ups gives a satisfying feeling.

What 2 parts of the game are tedious?
1. The pickups always come in a predictable pattern, which can get boring.
2. Sometimes the game ends too quickly, so you don’t feel like you had enough time to react.
